# 🎨 Welcome to **Artifex.js**

**Artifex.js** is a new open-source library designed to bridge the gap between **art and artificial intelligence**.  
Whether you're an artist, developer, or creative technologist, Artifex.js empowers you to manipulate, blend, and generate artistic visuals through simple, composable APIs.

---

## ✨ What Is Artifex.js?

Artifex.js is a **JavaScript toolkit** built for creative developers who want to harness the power of **AI models** for artistic expression.  
It provides high-level abstractions for working with **diffusion models, image transformers, style transfer systems**, and **neural composition tools** — all wrapped in a simple and expressive syntax.

You can think of it as:
> **TensorFlow for art**, or **Three.js for imagination**.

### Key Capabilities

- 🧠 **AI Model Manipulation** — Load, configure, and combine neural models with minimal setup.  
- 🧩 **Composable Pipelines** — Chain transformations like color synthesis, style merging, and depth mapping.  
- 🎨 **Generative Art Tools** — Create unique art pieces using latent diffusion or procedural blending.  
- ⚡ **Fast & Modular** — Built with WebGPU acceleration and ESM-first architecture.  
- 🪄 **Plug-in System** — Extend with your own artistic operators, filters, and render engines.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get started with a single command:

```bash
npm install artifex
````

Then create your first artistic generation:

```tsx
import { Artifex, Blend, StyleTransfer } from "artifex";

const ai = new Artifex();

const image = await ai
  .load("model://stable-diffusion")
  .pipe(Blend.with("texture://neon"))
  .pipe(StyleTransfer.from("artist://van-gogh"))
  .render("output.png");

console.log("✨ Artistic image generated:", image);
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Artifex supports both browser and Node.js environments, as well as integration with frameworks like **Next.js**, **React**, or **Three.js**.

---

## 🧭 Why We Built This

The motivation behind Artifex.js is simple:

> To make **AI-assisted creativity** more intuitive, reproducible, and open.

Most AI art tools are black boxes — you provide a prompt, and you get an image back.
With Artifex.js, you have full control over the creative pipeline:

* Adjust latent spaces
* Combine multiple styles
* Reuse seeds and layers
* Script complex generative flows

By giving artists **programmable control** over AI models, Artifex.js transforms machine learning into a **collaborative creative partner** — not just a generator.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Artifex.js is built on three conceptual layers:

1. **Core Engine** – Handles model loading, GPU acceleration, and tensor management.
2. **Operators** – Perform artistic transformations (e.g., Blend, Morph, Transfer).
3. **Pipelines** – Combine multiple operators into reproducible workflows.

This modular architecture makes it easy to experiment and extend.

> 🧩 **Note:** Every operator in Artifex is functional and composable — meaning you can chain them like JavaScript array methods.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Responsibility

AI art can inspire, but it also raises questions about authorship and originality.
At Artifex.js, we believe **tools should amplify human creativity, not replace it**.
Our mission is to empower artists to **own their process**, **curate their models**, and **celebrate the human touch** in digital creation.

> ⚠️ **Reminder:** Always respect model licenses, dataset origins, and the rights of living artists.
